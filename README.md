# react-understanding


## Why react
* React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* React is used to build single-page applications.
* React allows us to create reusable UI components.

## How does React Work?
* React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory - Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.
* React only changes what needs to be changed! - React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed.

## current react version - 18.2.0

## Setting up a React Environment
1. Install Node JS
2. Node JS includes npm

* If you have npx and Node.js installed, you can create a React application by using create-react-app.
npx create-react-app my-react-app - This will set up everything you need to run a React application.

## Run the React Application
cd my-react-app
npm start
